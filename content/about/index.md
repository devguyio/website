**Name:** Ahmed Abdalla

**Occupation:** Principal Software Engineer

**Location:** Germany

A principal software engineer at Red Hat who's part of the Knative Eventing team. My area of interest is the intersection of Linux, distributed systems and eventing systems. I've found my sweet spot in Knative, Kubernetes and the Cloud Native ecosystem. 

I live among the high level distributed systems architecture design and low level system daemons with a focus on code quality, and team productivity.

I had once an interest in entrepreneurship and startups using lean and agile approaches, with two trials for a technology innovation Egyptian startup.
